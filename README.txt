Synth Bass #2
-------------

Version 2021-04-05

Imitation of the Yamaha DX7 bass sound, a FM sythesis instrument that was popular in the 1980s. Made by roberto@zenvoid.org for the FreePats project.

These sound samples simulate the "BASS 1" patch of the DX7, used in many 1980s popular songs. Recorded from Hexter software synthesizer. Hexter is a free software program that accurately models the sound generation algorithm of the original instrument: http://dssi.sourceforge.net/hexter.html
